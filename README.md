# Neural Networks Hyper Params Experiment

This experiment explores the impact of hyperparameters on the performance of neural networks using the heart attack analysis and prediction dataset from Kaggle. The experiment involves training models with varying hidden layer sizes, neuron counts per layer, and activation functions. The performance is evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, and accuracy. 

Key findings include the effectiveness of the Tanh activation function in complex models and the benefits of increasing neuron counts over adding more layers.
